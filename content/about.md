# Hi there.

I love building things (mostly for the web) and celebrating the joy of programming. In my free time I enjoy gaming[^1], doing courses and trying out new programming languages.

Like the `/dev/null`[^2], I use this blog as a place to redirect unwanted streams of thoughts, ideas and rants about software development, programming and other things that interest me.

If youâ€™d like to connect, feel free to reach out on my [email](prakhar1989@gmail.com)
