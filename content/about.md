Hi there.

I'm Prakhar Srivastav and I love building things (mostly for the web) and celebrating the joy of programming. In my free time I enjoy gaming, [doing courses](https://www.class-central.com/@prakhar) and trying out new programming languages.

I use this blog as a place to redirect random streams of thoughts (much like `/dev/random`), ideas and rants about software development, programming and other things that interest me.

If youâ€™d like to connect, feel free to reach out on my [email](mailto:prakhar1989@gmail.com)
