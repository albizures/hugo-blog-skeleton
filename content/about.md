I use this website primarily to record and share my thoughts and ideas. I'm a software engineer by profession, but I have a wide variety of other interests. Some of the things I've been thinking about recently include company culture, common stereotypes, and social justice (check out [this talk](http://nishanttotla.github.io/earth-tones-talk/#/) I gave at a recent people of color meetup).

I consider adventure to be a big part of my identity -- not only the thrill-seeking kind, but also what allows me to lead a life of exploration and moving away from convention. Some of this appetite is satisfied by [long-distance running and biking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2749248), and [travel](/places). One of my long term goals is to attain enough financial independence to lead a life that primarily involves adventure in some capacity. At that point, I'll gladly give up my current one that involves hours looking at a computer screen every day.

Among other things, I enjoy playing music, reading, learning about new science and technology, and thinking about personal growth.
