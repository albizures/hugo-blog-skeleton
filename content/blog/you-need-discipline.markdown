Productivity, procrastination, discipline, motivation are topics all too common to appear on hacker forums - especially on HN where smart and (mostly) self-taught hackers gather around to discuss and learn from each other.

The below excerpt is from an 
[article](http://www.wisdomination.com/screw-motivation-what-you-need-is-discipline/) that surfaced today and unsurprisingly got a good bit of attention and discussion on the [forum](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8976451). 


> Productivity has no requisite mental states. For consistent, long-term results, discipline trumps motivation, runs circles around it, bangs its mom and eats its lunch.

> In summary, motivation is trying to feel like doing stuff. Discipline is doing it even if you don’t feel like it.

> You get to feel good afterwards.

> **How do you cultivate discipline? By building habits – starting as small as you can manage, even microscopic, and gathering momentum, reinvesting it in progressively bigger changes to your routine, and building a positive feedback loop**.

> Motivation is a counterproductive attitude to productivity. What counts is discipline.


I'm not really a big fan of the tone these writers take, which is possibly to get readers all amped up but I did find myself feverishly nodding to most of what I read. The major issue with the article is the fact that things aren't actually that black and white. You do absolutely need motivation to be disciplined.

The TL;DR of the article basically boils down to -

- Build habits
- Start small
- Keep at it

which is something I completely agree with.

As someone rightly [wrote](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8976537) - Let motivation tell you what you want, and discipline let you get there.
