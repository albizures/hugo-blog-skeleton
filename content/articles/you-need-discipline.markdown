> Productivity has no requisite mental states. For consistent, long-term results, discipline trumps motivation, runs circles around it, bangs its mom and eats its lunch.

> In summary, motivation is trying to feel like doing stuff. Discipline is doing it even if you don’t feel like it.

> You get to feel good afterwards.

> How do you cultivate discipline? By building habits – starting as small as you can manage, even microscopic, and gathering momentum, reinvesting it in progressively bigger changes to your routine, and building a positive feedback loop.

> Motivation is a counterproductive attitude to productivity. What counts is discipline.
