I believe that the best way to learn is by working on projects. Below is a growing list of projects that I have shipped encompassing different kinds of technologies.

<ul class="projects-list unstyled-list">
<li>
	<div class="project-item">
		<h3><a href="https://github.com/prakhar1989/gettup">Gettup</a></h3>
			<p class="stack">Python, Command-Line, Pypi</p>
			<p><a href="http://github.com/prakhar1989/Gettup">Gettup</a> is one of those scratch-your-itch projects where you instantly want to share a file right from your terminal. Maybe you are SSHed into a server and feel scp is too troublesome or you do not want to open a website and drag-drop (or worse, upload) a file? </p>
<p>Gettup is a simple command line utility which lets you share and upload files to the <a href="http://ge.tt/">ge.tt</a> sharing service quickly and easily. It uses the Ge.tt API to share a file and generate a URL that you can share. It features a LOT of cool options like bulk upload, ability to create and shares(a collection of files) and rename files. Feel free to go through the <a href="https://github.com/prakhar1989/gettup/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for the complete list. Gettup also helps me to tick off an item from my bucket list i.e. publishing a python package on the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gettup/0.3.0">Python Package Index!</a></p>

		<h3><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo">Postman Interceptor</a></h3>
		<p class="stack">Javascript, Sinon.js, Chrome Extension</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo">Postman Interceptor</a> is a chrome extension that gives <a href="http://getpostman.com">Postman</a> wings! It enables Postman to send restricted headers i.e. headers that cannot be send via XmlHttpRequest like User-Agent, Referrer etc. and send cookie information with any request.</p>
<p>The killer feature in the extension is the ability to capture any requests sent by the browser and forward them to Postman for inspection. If you are looking at inspecting if your website is making the right API calls then all you need to do is just turn on this extension and all your requests will be forwarded to Postman for you to inspect the headers, the form data and body. From a technical standpoint this was my foray into developing a chrome application - an ecosystem for which I have become quite fond of post the project. Lastly, writing tests for an extension was challenging but with availability of stubs and mocks in <a href="#">Sinon</a> they became a breeze.</p>
<p>Here is a short 20sec demo on how it works!</p>

		<h3><a href="http://dump.getpostman.com">PostmanBin</a></h3>

		<p><a href="http://github.com/prakhar1989/postmanbin">PostmanBin</a> is fork of the utterly useful <a href="http://httpbin.org">HttpBin</a> project by Kenneth Reitz. It takes the existing repo and uses Flask-Restful to build a RESTful api for a blog - useful for debugging requests via Postman or otherwise.</p>
