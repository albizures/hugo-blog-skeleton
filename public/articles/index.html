            	If you&rsquo;ve been keeping track, I&rsquo;ve hardly published a single article in the last month. In my defense, the last 7 months have been extremely hectic. High work pressure and a rather dense online course kept most of the drafts from seeing the light of day. Before I jump in reviewing the course i.e. Mining Massive DataSets (MMDS), here&rsquo;s a quick short story for some context. I first stumbled onto MMDS or CS246 (as its called in Stanford), a graduate level course on (you guessed it) data mining in early 2012 when I had recently finished Andrew Ng&rsquo;s course on Machine Learning.

            	If you&rsquo;ve been programming in Python for some time chances are you have come across decorators. Even though you might not know what decorators are and how they work, you&rsquo;ve surely used them as most of popular Python libraries use decorators (the familiar @ syntax) to make beautiful APIs. Flask, for example, exposes decorators for setting routes. Django has a familiar login_required decorator that allows the user to force authentication for a view.

            	Bloom Filters is one of those data structures that you don&rsquo;t generally learn about in a typical data structures 101 class, but wish you had learnt once you know about them. Despite reading several articles on bloom filters I was still finding it hard to grasp the concepts until the last week when I decided to sit down and not get up until I get the hang of it. Below is an article where I attempt to explain what I understood in a clear way (hopefully) so that others can learn.

            	So strangely enough the optimal thing do to in college if you want to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational version of college focused on &ldquo;entrepreneurship.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the classic version of college as education for its own sake. If you want to start a startup after college, what you should do in college is learn powerful things. And if you have genuine intellectual curiosity, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll naturally tend to do if you just follow your own inclinations.

            	I&rsquo;ve been trying out Rust for some time and have been totally loving it so far. Glad to see that Armin Ronacher, one of the programmers I highly respect feels the same! Rust is inspiring for many reasons. The biggest reason I like it is because it&rsquo;s practical. I tried Haskell, I tried Erlang and neither of those languages spoke &ldquo;I am a practical language&rdquo; to me. I know there are many programmers that adore them, but they are not for me.

            	Last week, I was pleasantly surprised to find an email by a correspondent of Economic Times (a leading newspaper in India) asking for permission to quote a comment I made on Hacker News in the newspaper&rsquo;s front page! I hope they have India on their radar! It would be awesome for the Indian Startup scene to hear all those great speakers live!

            	Why do you want to do great things? Seriously, dig into it. When I ask a lot of people in startups this question and dig long enough, it comes down to money&ndash; they want to be rich, they want to be free. Fact: I&rsquo;ve met these rich/free people and they are largely working their asses off to get more rich (and presumably more free?). The ones who make it (largely) LOVE THE GAME.

            	Just when you promise yourself that you are going to work on systems for a couple of weeks and not get diverted, you get to hear about new ways to kill time learning crypto As a programmer, my core strengths have always been knowing how to apologize to users, and composing funny tweets. While I can hook up a web template to a database and make the squigglies come out right, I cannot efficiently sort something for you on a whiteboard, or tell you where to get a monad.

            	I spent this weekend building a cool visualization to better understand Monte Carlo methods. With [p5.js]() just being released last week, I was anxiously looking for a project idea that I could use this library for. Thanks to a Functional Programming course that I was working on last week, the idea came soon enough. Monti Pi is a simple app that shows how you can carry out multiple Monte Carlo simulations to approximate the value of Pi.

To recap, the major problems with our existing code which convinced us to do a rewrite - The existing code was written by a team which was no longer with the project. No one on the existing team had a strong understanding of how the code worked. Without any structure, the code was extremely hard to maintain and understand.

            	Today morning while browsing The Changelog, I came across this interesting project called - Goal. g()(&lsquo;al&rsquo;) is a challenge whereby you need to write in as many languages as possible code which enables the code g()(&lsquo;al&rsquo;) to return the string &ldquo;goal&rdquo;, the code g()()(&lsquo;al&rsquo;) to return the string &ldquo;gooal&rdquo;, the code g()()()(&lsquo;al&rsquo;) return the string &ldquo;goooal&rdquo;, etc. This sounded a good way to kill a couple of hours on a lazy holiday so I decided to give this a shot in a couple of programming languages I know.

            	On a recent (rather long) flight, while I was devouring Jon Bentley&rsquo;s Programming Pearls, I came across this rather interesting problem. The problem is simple - How will you a rotate a string of length n by i steps in place i.e. without using any extra space? The example shown below makes it quite clear. Now the easiest way to do this is to simply save the i chars in a separate vector, shift the remaining chars by i and finally, paste the initial i items at the back.

            	Last week, Marco Arment launched a new product on HN, Overcast - An iPhone app that makes listening to podcasts much easier (and more fun). There was a lot of productive discussion which made me realize that I need to give podcasts a serious chance. Given that I would be travelling soon, I went ahead, downloaded the most popular podcast app for Android and added a couple of feeds (thanks to this HN thread for recommendations).

It allows you to create streams and then push data via a simple HTTP call. The primary motivation behind the service is to enable devices connected via Internet of Things to push data online easily. I had been crawling a few websites to need of latest remittance rates to my home country (the rates offered for remittance differ quite substantially from the current spot rates).

Although I have never written a single line of code for iOS (in Objective C) I got so excited that within no time I was installing Xcode 6 to give playground &amp; Swift a shot. After spending a week with Swift I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that it is a very well designed programming language.

Every successful engineer I’ve met, upon finishing up a design or getting ready for a project, will continually ask their peers questions along the lines of: What could I be missing? How will this not work? Will you please shoot as many holes as possible into my thinking on this? Even if it’s technically sound, is it understandable enough for the rest of the organization to operate, troubleshoot, and extend it?

            	In this post, we&rsquo;re going to talk about a seemingly easy but an important topic - organizing and structuring your flask applications. As mentioned earlier, getting started with flask is super easy. Unlike django, flask doesn&rsquo;t follow a directory structure when you start a new app. Flask will not complain even if all of your code resides in a single main.py file. But we all know that that is not the way to go.

            	Steve Klabnik, the developer at Balanced recently put up a post on the company blog talking about doing TDD for APIs where he advocates a strong case for following Test Driven Development for APIs. For a lot of companies like Balanced, Stripe, Parse etc the API is their primary product. Hence, it makes sense to have strong development and testing practices for these APIs. TDD has taken off quite well with DHH and the ruby community strongly making claims of it solving a lot of problems and guaranteeing robust code.

            	I&rsquo;ve been meaning to start a write a series on Flask which is a micro-framework for developing web applications in python. In Ruby parlance, flask is to Sinatra what Django is to Rails. The nicest thing (and most confusing for beginners) about Flask is that its quite barebones on the onset. A simple hello world application in Flask is just about 7 lines as shown below. However, going from hello world to full fledged application is a daunting task in itself for a beginner.

As a part of new project our goal is to allow customers to checkout as guests i.e. without the need of creating an account with Xcite. This allows us to reduce a step for customers who just want quickly purchase something off the website and be on their way.

            	If you&rsquo;ve used Django before, one of the things that you surely miss (apart from the django-admin, of course) is class based (or generic) views. Class based views allow you to structure your views and reuse code by harnessing inheritance and mixins. This allows you to create generic views for routine tasks and simply inherit from them for similar views. In flask 0.7 class based views were introduced which act similar to generic views in Django.

            	If you&rsquo;ve got anything to do with Akamai&rsquo;s caching, surely there must have come a time where you needed to find out whether your content is being cached at Akamai. Pragma Headers The easiest way to test whether your content is cached at Akamai is to do via custom Pragma headers. What are Pragma headers you might say? The HTTP Specification has a simple definition of Pragma headers. The Pragma general-header field is used to include implementation-specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the request/response chain.

            	On 12th May 2013, Guido accepted the Python Enhancement Proposal 435 which suggests adding an Enum type to the Python standard library. The news caused a lot of commotion in the Python community and generated (mostly) healthy discussions on Hacker News. In this post I&rsquo;ll give an introduction to what enums are and talk about how you can use them in your programs. Enumerated Types According to Wikipedia, an enumerated type is a data type consisting of a set of named values called elements, members or enumerators of the type.

            	At Facebook, I described myself as &ldquo;the engineer who hates PHP the least&rdquo; and have also been called a &ldquo;PHP idiot savant&rdquo;. While I&rsquo;m not really a fan of PHP, my understanding of it is extremely deep so there&rsquo;s a huge activation energy for me to learn something else. I also think language choice is far less important than most people make it out to be; in my experience, the people who I have encountered who scoff the hardest at PHP and cry the most loudly about the importance of languages tend to also be really bad at doing any useful work in the languages they advocate.

Below is simple, straight, no-nonsense guide on how to deploy a flask app on a Linux server using Nginx, Gunicorn and Supervisor. A disclaimer: this guide will not tell you what these technologies are. Specifically, I will not talk about why you should use nginx + gunicorn instead of apache + mod_wsgi.

His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on.

Answer: Not thinking enough For quite a while, I’ve been disturbed by the emphasis on language in computer science. One result of that emphasis is programmers who are C++ experts but can’t write programs that do what they’re supposed to. The typical computer science response is that programmers need to use the right programming/specification/development language instead of/in addition to C++.

Blueprints have been a rather recent addition to flask (introduced in version 0.7) and were added to help users structure large applications into reusable components. Blueprints What exactly are blueprints? Lets see what the official documentation has to say. Flask uses a concept of blueprints for making application components and supporting common patterns within an application or across applications.

            	I found this great statement made by the WhatsApp founders on their blog about why they don&rsquo;t rely on ads and instead charge customers for the service. This is getting recirculated now that WhatsApp is looking at being acquired by Facebook at a valuation of around $19B. It interesting to see that while tons of apps rely on advertising as a key part of their business model there are companies who strive to go against it.

            	It’s important to note that that I don’t particularly care about the outward perception of the above Github chart. I think that’s the most important take away from this experiment: this is about a change that you’re making in your life for yourself not a change that you’re making to satisfy someone else’s perception of your work. The same goes for any form of dieting or exercise: if you don’t care about improving yourself then you’ll never actually succeed.
