<p>Last week at WWDC Apple made the most exciting announcement (for developers at least) of launching a new programming language - Swift. Although I have never written a single line of code for iOS (in Objective C) I got so excited that within no time I was installing Xcode 6 to give playground &amp; Swift a shot.</p>

<p>After spending a week with Swift I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that it is a very well designed programming language. For a Python/JS developer like me I was able to get productive very easily. It has strong remanents of Scala which is something I definitely I can&rsquo;t dig enough.</p>

<p>Below is a small list of features that I love the most about Swift. Consider this is an initial evaluation only, as I gain more experience I will blog about using Protocols, Enumerations and Generics with more practical examples.</p>

<h3 id="type-inference:9c765f6cd3c9cb3494c0676a5cd8e7b9">Type Inference</h3>

<p>One of the biggest inhibitions that developers with experience in dynamic languages like Python / Ruby have towards static compiled languages is the verbosity in the syntax. Repeatedly declaring <code>String name = &quot;abc&quot;</code> and <code>int age = 23</code> gets frustrating and it might make you think - why isn&rsquo;t my computer smart enough to figure out that <code>23</code> is indeed an integer. In Swift, this is as simple as</p>

<pre><code>let age = 23      // int
let name = &quot;nasd&quot; // string
let money = 23.3  // double
</code></pre>

<p>Modern languages like Go embrace type inference and in my opinion it is one of reasons why Go saw an upsurge of adoption within the Python / Ruby community.</p>

<h3 id="optionals:9c765f6cd3c9cb3494c0676a5cd8e7b9">Optionals</h3>

<p>An optional value either contains a value or a <code>nil</code> to indicate that a value is missing. I first learnt about the <code>Option</code> type in Scala and the benefits of using a dedicated type for this became evident early on. Being a strongly typed language, Swift encourages using optionals to ensure safety.</p>

<pre><code># in the python world one would 
# do the following
msg = raw_prompt()
if msg {
  // raises a compile error
  print(msg + &quot;, world&quot;)
}
</code></pre>

<p>While this is an accepted practice in lots of languages, the right way in Swift to do this is like this</p>

<pre><code>let msg: String? = &quot;hello&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This tells the compiler that the variable <code>msg</code> can have a value or be a <code>nil</code>. Why is this awesome? I think this is definitely better than remembering the arcane rules other programming languages have. For example, in some cases a blank String is <code>truthy</code> while in others it is <code>falsy</code> e.g. Javascript. In PHP as an empty string is <code>falsy</code> one would expect the string <code>&quot;0&quot;</code> to be <code>truthy</code> but its not <em>[this is because the <code>&quot;0&quot;</code> is typecasted into a int]</em>.</p>

<p>How do you use it? Let us assume you have a <code>User</code> object that stores information about a user and you define a collection that stores a collection of the <code>User</code> object. You need to define a <code>findById</code> function that returns the User object associated with that <code>id</code>. Here&rsquo;s how you can do it</p>

<p>{% highlight scala %}
func findById(id: Int, users: User[]) -&gt; User? {
  for u in Users {
    if u.id == id {
      return u
    }<br />
  }
  return nil
}</p>

<p>// user is bound to value in case nil is not returned
if let user = findById(1, users) {
  println(&ldquo;user found: (user.name)&ldquo;)
} else {
  println(&ldquo;user not found&rdquo;)
}
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>One last thing that might trip up beginners is the user <code>!</code> to force unwrapping of the optional. Using a <code>!</code> simply means that you&rsquo;re sure the optional contains a value and you want to access it.</p>

<p>{% highlight scala %}
if findById(1, users) {
  println(&ldquo;user found: (findById(1, users)!.name)&ldquo;)
} else {
  println(&ldquo;user not found&rdquo;)
}
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>Having optionals helps you keep your mind free from all these rules and helps eliminate potential bugs.</p>

<h3 id="ranges:9c765f6cd3c9cb3494c0676a5cd8e7b9">Ranges</h3>

<p>Very simple and straightforward - ranges are my most preferred way of iterating through a collection of integers. Ranges are present in both Python and Ruby, and I&rsquo;d be lying if I say that I don&rsquo;t miss them in Javascript.</p>

<p>{% highlight scala %}
// Swift
for i in 0..10 {
  println(i)
}</p>

<p>// Python
for i in range(0, 10) {
  print(i)
}</p>

<p>// Ruby
for i in 0..10 {
  print i
}
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>Unfortunately usage of ranges in Go are different from the example above. Since there&rsquo;s no way to create an array (or a slice) by just specifying the start and end of the collection, <code>Range(1,20)</code> doesn&rsquo;t work. From the <a href="http://golang.org/ref/spec#RangeClause">documentation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The expression on the right in the &ldquo;range&rdquo; clause is called the range expression, which may be an array, pointer to an array, slice, string, map, or channel permitting receive operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing that both Go and Swift share (w.r.t. ranges) is ignoring values using the <code>_</code></p>

<p>{% highlight scala %}
var (n, answer, base) = (4, 10, 2)
for _ in 0..n {
  answer += base
}
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>This is a nice-to-have feature if you don&rsquo;t want to populate the local namespace.</p>

<h3 id="closures:9c765f6cd3c9cb3494c0676a5cd8e7b9">Closures</h3>

<p>If you have any Javascript experience under your belt, chances are you have used closures. Closures are common in languages in which functions are treated as first-class citizens. I&rsquo;ll not go into details of explaining what closures are but to put it in one line - they are self-contained blocks of code that can be passed around your code. Closures basically capture or <em>close</em> the values of the data from the context in which they were defined.</p>

<p>Swift allows a lot of syntactic sugar when it comes to closures, making them a joy to use. The 4 primary features are</p>

<ul>
<li>Inferring parameter and return value types from context.</li>
<li>Implicit returns from single-expression closures</li>
<li>Shorthand argument names</li>
<li>Trailing closure syntax</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me illustrate the points below with a practical example. We will use the <code>sort</code> function which takes a collection and a function (closure) on which the function is sorted.</p>

<p>{% highlight scala %}
let fruits = [&ldquo;apples&rdquo;, &ldquo;oranges&rdquo;, &ldquo;banana&rdquo;, &ldquo;pear&rdquo;]</p>

<p>func longest(s1: String, s2: String) -&gt; Bool {
  return countElements(s1) &gt; countElements(s2)
}</p>

<p>// returns [&ldquo;oranges&rdquo;, &ldquo;banana&rdquo;, &ldquo;apples&rdquo;, &ldquo;pear&rdquo;]
sort(fruits, longest)
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>The equivalent closure for to accomplish the above would be -
{% highlight scala %}
sort(fruits, { (s1: String, s2: String) -&gt; Bool in
  return countElements(s1) &gt; countElements(s2)
})
{% endhighlight %}
The code after <code>in</code> begins the closure. We will see how the features provided by Swift makes it much much easier to do the same thing.</p>

<p><strong>Inferring parameter and return value types from context</strong>.
{% highlight scala %}
// removing the type information
sort(fruits, { (s1, s2) in
  return countElements(s1) &gt; countElements(s2)
})
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p><strong>Implicit returns from single-expression closures</strong>
{% highlight scala %}
// remove the explicit return
sort(fruits, { (s1, s2) in<br />
  countElements(s1) &gt; countElements(s2)
})
{% endhighlight %}
<strong>Shorthand argument names</strong></p>

<p>{% highlight scala %}
// $0 refers to the first arg, $1 refers to the second
sort(fruits, { countElements($0) &gt; countElements($1) })
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p><strong>Trailing closure syntax</strong>
{% highlight scala %}
// syntactic sugar to allow passing a closure outside of a function call
sort(fruits) { countElements($0) &gt; countElements($1) }
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<h3 id="map-filter-and-reduce:9c765f6cd3c9cb3494c0676a5cd8e7b9">Map, Filter and Reduce</h3>

<p>Directly incorporated from the functional programming world, the functions <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> are available on all collections to help you iterate through a collection, perform an operation and return a new collection. The syntax is similar to closure so it is quite intuitive once you get a hang of it.</p>

<p>{% highlight scala %}
let numbers = [12, 49, 23, 44, 143]</p>

<p>let squares = numbers.map { $0 * $0 } // squares of numbers
// squares [144, 2401, 529, 1936, 20449]</p>

<p>let even = numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0}  // filter all even
// even [12, 44]</p>

<p>let sum = numbers.reduce(0, combine: {$0 + $1}) // finding the sum of the elements
// sum 271
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried Swift yet, I encourage you to give it a shot. Its a fun language and Apple&rsquo;s building a great ecosystem around it. Expect people to share their playground files with cool demos once Xcode 6 becomes stable. I am super excited to see what the future holds!</p>
