            	So strangely enough the optimal thing do to in college if you want to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational version of college focused on &ldquo;entrepreneurship.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the classic version of college as education for its own sake. If you want to start a startup after college, what you should do in college is learn powerful things. And if you have genuine intellectual curiosity, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll naturally tend to do if you just follow your own inclinations.

            	Why do you want to do great things? Seriously, dig into it. When I ask a lot of people in startups this question and dig long enough, it comes down to money&ndash; they want to be rich, they want to be free. Fact: I&rsquo;ve met these rich/free people and they are largely working their asses off to get more rich (and presumably more free?). The ones who make it (largely) LOVE THE GAME.

            	Brilliant article on what differentiates senior engineers. Every successful engineer I’ve met, upon finishing up a design or getting ready for a project, will continually ask their peers questions along the lines of: What could I be missing? How will this not work? Will you please shoot as many holes as possible into my thinking on this? Even if it’s technically sound, is it understandable enough for the rest of the organization to operate, troubleshoot, and extend it?

            	Stop Making Excuses. Go Build Something The point is, that you can and should teach yourself some new skills. You’re way closer to being employable than I was, that’s for sure. It may take some evenings and weekends, but they’ll be some of the most fun evening and weekends you ever have. Find something that you want to do and build it. Fall in love with the idea, but be ready to dump it for something better.
