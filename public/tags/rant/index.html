            	Last week, I was pleasantly surprised to find an email by a correspondent of Economic Times (a leading newspaper in India) asking for permission to quote a comment I made on Hacker News in the newspaper&rsquo;s front page! I hope they have India on their radar! It would be awesome for the Indian Startup scene to hear all those great speakers live! Who knew that a comment on HN would end up on the front-page of a newspaper!

            	Just when you promise yourself that you are going to work on systems for a couple of weeks and not get diverted, you get to hear about new ways to kill time learning crypto As a programmer, my core strengths have always been knowing how to apologize to users, and composing funny tweets. While I can hook up a web template to a database and make the squigglies come out right, I cannot efficiently sort something for you on a whiteboard, or tell you where to get a monad.

            	At Facebook, I described myself as &ldquo;the engineer who hates PHP the least&rdquo; and have also been called a &ldquo;PHP idiot savant&rdquo;. While I&rsquo;m not really a fan of PHP, my understanding of it is extremely deep so there&rsquo;s a huge activation energy for me to learn something else. I also think language choice is far less important than most people make it out to be; in my experience, the people who I have encountered who scoff the hardest at PHP and cry the most loudly about the importance of languages tend to also be really bad at doing any useful work in the languages they advocate.

            	When Joe Armstrong, the creator of Erlang, writes a post on &ldquo;Programming is Hard&rdquo; you cant help but say to yourself - You&rsquo;re not alone! If you’ve got this far, you’ll understand that I think programming is pretty damn difficult. That’s why workplaces are designed to make programming even more difficult. We have open plan offices which provide a noisy environment to break our concentration, mobile phones to disturb us, and internet to distract us.

            	The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on.

            	Leslie Lamport, the creator the famous Paxos&rsquo; Algorithm and LaTeX, in his paper talks about what programmers are doing wrong? Answer: Not thinking enough For quite a while, I’ve been disturbed by the emphasis on language in computer science. One result of that emphasis is programmers who are C++ experts but can’t write programs that do what they’re supposed to. The typical computer science response is that programmers need to use the right programming/specification/development language instead of/in addition to C++.

            	I found this great statement made by the WhatsApp founders on their blog about why they don&rsquo;t rely on ads and instead charge customers for the service. This is getting recirculated now that WhatsApp is looking at being acquired by Facebook at a valuation of around $19B. It interesting to see that while tons of apps rely on advertising as a key part of their business model there are companies who strive to go against it.

            	It’s important to note that that I don’t particularly care about the outward perception of the above Github chart. I think that’s the most important take away from this experiment: this is about a change that you’re making in your life for yourself not a change that you’re making to satisfy someone else’s perception of your work. The same goes for any form of dieting or exercise: if you don’t care about improving yourself then you’ll never actually succeed.
