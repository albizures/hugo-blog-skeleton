      <title>A Happy Accident</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was pleasantly surprised to find an email by a correspondent of &lt;a href=&#34;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/&#34;&gt;Economic Times&lt;/a&gt; (a leading newspaper in India) asking for permission to quote a comment I made on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7698688&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; in the newspaper&amp;rsquo;s front page!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope they have India on their radar! It would be awesome for the Indian Startup scene to hear all those great speakers live!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knew that a comment on HN would end up on the front-page of a newspaper!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just when you promise yourself that you are going to work on &lt;a href=&#34;http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/&#34;&gt;systems&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of weeks and not get diverted, you get to hear about new ways to kill time learning &lt;a href=&#34;http://cryptopals.com/&#34;&gt;crypto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a programmer, my core strengths have always been knowing how to apologize to users, and composing funny tweets. While I can hook up a web template to a database and make the squigglies come out right, I cannot efficiently sort something for you on a whiteboard, or tell you where to get a monad. From my vantage point, crypto looms as high as Mount Olympus. - Maciej Ceglowski on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/&#34;&gt;Matasano Crypto Challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It Ends</title>
      <link>http://192.241.186.225/articles/it-ends/</link>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it ends! For the past 64 days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard to keep contributing to open source, to keep committing meaningful commits each day. Yesterday, I decided to end it. Nearing the end, it started getting a bit tiring. I was spending my time in office thinking what will I work on today. In the start it was good, I had a couple of good postman projects to take care of. But after release, I was in search of a new project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Go had been on my mind for quite some time and somewhere between my time in Postman, I did give it a shot. But I realized that to build something meaningful, I&amp;rsquo;d have to put some serious time in it. Bogged by the pressure of releasing code each day I was not feeling comfortable in taking time out to learn a new language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly and slowly the anxiety to contribute code each day was sapping out all the fun. Rather than getting excited I started dreading going home to work on something. Finally, it was yesterday that I decided that this should stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I had a great run. It felt great to have stuck onto something for this long. Working for 64 days non-stop without a break, alongside the day job is not an easy feat and I&amp;rsquo;m proud that I did it. To top it all, Newman was the longest project that I worked on this long at a stretch. It has given me the confidence to work on more ambitious projects that require serious commitment over longer timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan for this month is to get back to learning some CS theory. I am vacilatting between doing a MOOC and studying a book on algorithms. This is obviously alongside practicing writing Golang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I will soon have another cool project that I can start working on after this short break! Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what the future holds!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evan Priestly on PHP</title>

&lt;p&gt;At Facebook, I described myself as &amp;ldquo;the engineer who hates PHP the least&amp;rdquo; and have also been called a &amp;ldquo;PHP idiot savant&amp;rdquo;. While I&amp;rsquo;m not really a fan of PHP, my understanding of it is extremely deep so there&amp;rsquo;s a huge activation energy for me to learn something else. I also think language choice is far less important than most people make it out to be; in my experience, the people who I have encountered who scoff the hardest at PHP and cry the most loudly about the importance of languages tend to also be really bad at doing any useful work in the languages they advocate.  - Evan Priestly&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Write Code Everyday</title>
      <link>http://192.241.186.225/articles/write-code-everyday/</link>

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that that I don’t particularly care about the outward perception of the above Github chart. I think that’s the most important take away from this experiment: this is about a change that you’re making in your life for yourself not a change that you’re making to satisfy someone else’s perception of your work. The same goes for any form of dieting or exercise: if you don’t care about improving yourself then you’ll never actually succeed. - John Resig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its inspiring to read about how programming greats like &lt;a href=&#34;http://ejohn.org&#34;&gt;John Resig&lt;/a&gt; are struggling with working on side projects and the changes they make to their lifestyle in order to push something meaningful each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think no matter how experienced or productive one is as a programmer, each of us struggles with the same issues of feeling lazy, bored and occasionally too burnt out to code. What&amp;rsquo;s motivated me most after the post is the fact that if John Resig can work this hard to write code each day so should I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently on a 20 day streak github, which is the highest I&amp;rsquo;ve been on this far. Working on &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/a85/newman&#34;&gt;newman&lt;/a&gt; has been both fun and challenging to keep me engaged for 3 weeks. I&amp;rsquo;m quite anxious on how I will keep up the streak post the release but as John says, the important point is to make a change in yourself for something that you care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who haven&amp;rsquo;t read the blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d strongly encourage you to do so!&lt;/p&gt;
