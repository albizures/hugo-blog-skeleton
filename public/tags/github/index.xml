&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it ends! For the past 64 days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard to keep contributing to open source, to keep committing meaningful commits each day. Yesterday, I decided to end it. Nearing the end, it started getting a bit tiring. I was spending my time in office thinking what will I work on today. In the start it was good, I had a couple of good postman projects to take care of. But after release, I was in search of a new project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Go had been on my mind for quite some time and somewhere between my time in Postman, I did give it a shot. But I realized that to build something meaningful, I&amp;rsquo;d have to put some serious time in it. Bogged by the pressure of releasing code each day I was not feeling comfortable in taking time out to learn a new language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly and slowly the anxiety to contribute code each day was sapping out all the fun. Rather than getting excited I started dreading going home to work on something. Finally, it was yesterday that I decided that this should stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I had a great run. It felt great to have stuck onto something for this long. Working for 64 days non-stop without a break, alongside the day job is not an easy feat and I&amp;rsquo;m proud that I did it. To top it all, Newman was the longest project that I worked on this long at a stretch. It has given me the confidence to work on more ambitious projects that require serious commitment over longer timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan for this month is to get back to learning some CS theory. I am vacilatting between doing a MOOC and studying a book on algorithms. This is obviously alongside practicing writing Golang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I will soon have another cool project that I can start working on after this short break! Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what the future holds!&lt;/p&gt;
