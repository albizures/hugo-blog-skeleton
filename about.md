### Hi there.

I love building things (mostly for the web) and celebrating the joy of programming. In my free time I enjoy gaming[^1], [doing courses](https://www.class-central.com/u/14552) and trying out new programming languages. 

Like the `/dev/null`[^2], I use this blog as a place to redirect <del>un</del>wanted streams of thoughts, ideas and rants about software development, programming and other things that interest me.

If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out on my [email](mailto:prakhar1989@gmail.com)
