Last week, I was pleasantly surprised to find an email by a correspondent of [Economic Times](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/) (a leading newspaper in India) asking for permission to quote a comment I made on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7698688) in the newspaper's front page!

> I hope they have India on their radar! It would be awesome for the Indian Startup scene to hear all those great speakers live!

Who knew that a comment on HN would end up on the front-page of a newspaper!
